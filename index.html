    <p>Insect sting allergy is the term commonly given to the allergic response o
    f an animal in response to the bite or sting of an insect. Typically, insects
    which generate allergic responses are either stinging insects (wasps, bees,
    hornets and ants) or biting insects (mosquitoes, ticks). Stinging insects
    inject venom into their victims, whilst biting insects normally introduce
    anti-coagulants into their victims.The great majority of insect allergic
    animals just have a simple allergic response – a reaction local to the sting
    site which appears as just a swelling arising from the release of histamine
    and other chemicals from the body tissues near to the sting site. The swelling,
    if allergic, can be helped by the provision of an anti-histamine ointment
    as well as an ice pack.Mosquito allergy may result in a collection of
    symptoms called skeeter syndrome that occur after a bite. This syndrome may
    be mistaken for an infection such as cellulitis. In anaphylactic patients
    the response is more aggressive leading to a systemic reaction where the
    response progresses from the sting site around the whole body. This is
    potentially something very serious and can lead to anaphylaxis, which is
    potentially life-threatening. The majority of individuals who receive a
    sting from an insect experience local reactions. It is estimated that 5-10%
    of individuals will experience a generalized systemic reaction that can
    involve symptoms ranging from hives to wheezing and even anaphylaxis. In
    the United States approximately 40 people die each year from anaphylaxis
    due to stinging insect allergy. Internal Medicine Paul Edward Farmer
    (born October 26, 1959) is an American anthropologist and physician who
    is best known for his humanitarian work providing suitable health care to
    rural and under-resourced areas in developing countries, beginning in Haiti.
    Co-founder of an international social justice and health organization,
    Partners In Health (PIH), he is known as "the man who would cure the world,"
    as described in the book, Mountains Beyond Mountains by Tracy Kidder.</p>
